Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x=5
y="john"

print(x)
print(y)
#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
